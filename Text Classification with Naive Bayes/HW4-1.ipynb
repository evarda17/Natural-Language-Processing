However, some of the translations are not perfect, and you may encounter some words in other languages. Unfortunately, NLP researchers often have to work with messy data. If you are curious about the crowdsourcing translation effort for messages from Haiti in particular, feel free to check out this paper (https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/munro2010translation.pdf).\n",
