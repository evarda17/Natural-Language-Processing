# Python Networking Basics Project

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to a project focusing on Python's networking capabilities. It demonstrates how to utilize Python for web-related tasks, specifically leveraging the `urllib` library for making HTTP requests. The primary objective is to grasp the fundamentals of network programming with Python, which includes crafting HTTP requests and managing responses.

### Contents

- `hw_python.py`: A Python script illustrating the use of `urllib` to execute HTTP requests.
- `HW2-1.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook providing an interactive exploration of Python's networking features. This notebook contains comprehensive examples, exercises, and explanations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To effectively engage with the scripts and notebooks in this repository, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your device.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for accessing the `.ipynb` file. Jupyter can be installed via pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

- An active internet connection to perform HTTP requests.

### Installation

To begin, clone this repository to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>
```

### Running the Python Script

Execute the Python script (`hw_python.py`) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python hw_python.py
```

### Using the Jupyter Notebook

To open and interact with the Jupyter notebook (`HW2-1.ipynb`), launch Jupyter Notebook in the project's root directory by executing:

```bash
jupyter notebook HW2-1.ipynb
```

## Project Tasks

- Explore the process of making HTTP requests with Python's `urllib` library.
- Learn to handle various response types effectively.
- Utilize the acquired networking concepts to retrieve and process web data.

*Detailed instructions and tasks can be found within the Jupyter notebook.*
